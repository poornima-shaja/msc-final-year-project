# 🌌 Universe Playlist  
### AI-Based Emotion Driven Music Recommendation System  
### MSc Final Year Project  

---

## 🚀 Project Summary  
Universe Playlist is an AI-powered web application developed as part of my MSc final year project. The system captures a user’s facial expression in real-time using a webcam, detects the underlying emotion using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, and generates personalized music recommendations based on the detected emotion, selected language, and preferred singer.

The project integrates Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Full-Stack Web Development to create an intelligent mood-aware music recommendation system.

## 🧠 System Workflow  
1. User logs into the system  
2. Selects preferred language and singer  
3. Webcam captures facial image  
4. CNN model predicts emotion (Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral, Surprise)  
5. System dynamically generates a YouTube search link  
6. User receives personalized mood-based music recommendations
